## MockRedis
### This is my own implementation of Redis.

#### What is Redis?

Redis (REmote DIctionary Server) is an open source, in-memory, NoSQL key/value store that is used primarily as an application cache or quick-response database.

It can also work as a *Message Broker*, but I will first be implementing the cache as described above.
